Cancer disease body 's cell grow uncontrollably spread part body

Cancer start almost human body make trillion cell human cell grow multiply process call cell division form cell body cell grow old damaged die cell place

orderly process break abnormal damaged cell grow multiply cell form tumor lump tissue tumor cancerous cancerous benign

cancerous tumor spread invade nearby tissue travel distant place body form tumor process call metastasis cancerous tumor call malignant tumor cancer form solid tumor cancer blood leukemia generally

benign tumor spread invade nearby tissue remove benign tumor grow back cancerous tumor benign tumor large cause serious symptom life threaten benign tumor brain

difference Cancer cell normal cell
cancer cell differ normal cell way instance cancer cell

grow absence signal grow normal cell grow receive signal
ignore signal cell stop divide die process program cell death apoptosis
invade nearby area spread area body normal cell stop grow encounter cell normal cell move body
blood vessel grow tumor blood vessel supply tumor oxygen nutrient remove waste product tumor
hide immune system immune system eliminate damaged abnormal cell
trick immune system cancer cell stay alive grow instance cancer cell convince immune cell protect tumor attack
accumulate multiple change chromosome duplication deletion chromosome part cancer cell double normal number chromosome
rely kind nutrient normal cell addition cancer cell make energy nutrient way normal cell cancer cell grow quickly
time cancer cell rely heavily abnormal behavior survive researcher advantage fact develop therapy target abnormal feature cancer cell cancer therapy prevent blood vessel grow tumor essentially starve tumor nutrient
