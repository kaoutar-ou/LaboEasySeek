development machine learn model base main step typically data scientist manage oversee process

step select prepare training datum set data feed machine learn model learn solve problem design

datum label order model characteristic identify unlabeled model spot extract recur feature

case datum carefully prepare organize clean training machine learning model bias result future prediction directly impact

step select algorithm run training dataset type algorithm depend type volume training datum type problem solve

step train algorithm iterative process variable run algorithm result compare produce weight bias adjust increase accuracy result

variable run algorithm produce correct result time algorithm train machine learn model

fourth final step improve model model datum origin depend problem solve machine learn model design detect spam email

part machine learn model robot vacuum cleaner ingest datum result interaction real world move furniture add object room efficiency accuracy increase time
